# Churn-Prediction
Attracting new customers:

Costs alot of money rather than keeping existing customers to companies

Using a dataset from kaggle we will try to predict whether or not a customer will discontinue doing business with a company or service

For example telecom, in Canada there are alot of services that many people will shift through throughout their lives. How can companies reduce this process?

Trying to predict customer churn, meaning customers that are at high risk of leaving the service from said company

In order to accomplish this, the company needs to develop views of their customers on interactions through the channels of the service. and try to preserve their position in the market of competitors with existing customers

We need to explore a few characteristics from the dataset given, not knowning whats inside the data set we need to:

- Explore whats in the dataset
- Patterns in customer retention (meaning between churn and other factors)
- Explore the features of the dataset in order to devleop an understanding
- Whats the most profitable or useful service that keeps customers?
- Which features in the dataset cause this profit
- What is the correlation between the features and predicting class
- Determine these features and try to classify a customer using models
- Maybe use multiple models such as Logistic Regression, SVM etc.

Predicting customer Churn, meaning customers that are at high risk of leaving a service from telecom companies using a ML Classification prediction, with Data analysis and preprocessing

Using Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit learn in order to make predicitons on whether or not a customer will Churn 

Reached an accuracy of 81% using a Logistic Regression model in order to predict, and 73% accuracy score using an SVM model
